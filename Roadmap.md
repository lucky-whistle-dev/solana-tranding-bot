# Roadmap for Developing a Solana Trading Bot

### Hour 1: Project Setup and Requirements Analysis
  - Task 1: Set up the development environment.
  
Install necessary tools like Node.js, Solana CLI, and any relevant IDEs.
Set up GitHub repo for version control.
Folder and spreadsheets for $ tracking, documentation

  - Task 2: Analyze requirements and establish goals.
Understand the goal of achieving a 2% daily average return (every 24 hours) or maximum returns at the same time daily (10am est) .
Review APIs (Jupiter API for trading, BirdEye for live data).



### Hour 2-3: API Integration and Data Access
  - Task 3: Integrate Jupiter API.

Establish API connection for buying and selling tokens.
Ensure secure handling of API keys and Solana wallet integration.
Task 4: Set up WebSocket or live data connection to BirdEye.
Fetch live data for token prices and market trends.


### Hour 4-5: Algorithm Development
  - Task 5: Design trading algorithm.

Develop an initial strategy for trading based on market data.
Implement logic for buying low and selling high, considering the 1% return goal.
  - Task 6: Code the algorithm.

Translate the strategy into executable code.
Ensure the algorithm can process live data and make decisions in real-time.


### Hour 6: Backtesting
  - Task 7: Develop backtesting framework.

Use historical data to test the effectiveness of your trading algorithm.
Adjust the algorithm based on backtesting results.


### Hour 7: Integration and Testing
  - Task 8: Integrate all components.

Ensure that the trading algorithm, Jupiter API, and BirdEye data work seamlessly.
  - Task 9: Conduct live testing with minimal risk.

Use a small amount of SOL to test live trading under real market conditions.


### Hour 8: Final Adjustments and Deployment
  - Task 10: Make final adjustments.

Refine the algorithm based on testing results.
Double-check security measures, especially around API keys and wallet access.
  - Task 11: Prepare for deployment.

Set up the bot on a reliable server or cloud platform.
Ensure the bot can run continuously and autonomously.
  - Task 12: Deploy and monitor.

Launch the bot.
Closely monitor performance for the first few trading cycles.

Goal: deploy algo once backtested to validate 2% daily return (7 day testing) 

Launch 10k 
Daily maintenance and necessary adjustment until steady 
Hold 333 days 
Jan 18 ‘24 launch : 10,000 USD 
Dec 16 ‘24 end : 7,100,000 USD 

Assume Jan 18 live launch day Consider holding, taking profits, or compounding until the new year start 2025 
333 days = 7.1 Million USDC 
350 days = >10 Million USDC

1. Define Trading Strategies

Quantitative Analysis: Utilize quantitative methods to identify profitable trading opportunities. This might include mean reversion strategies, momentum trading, or pair trading.
Machine Learning Models: Implement AI models like neural networks or reinforcement learning algorithms to predict price movements and optimize trade execution.

2. Data Collection and Management

Market Data: Gather real-time and historical data from exchanges and other sources. This includes price data, order book depth, trade volumes, and more.
Alternative Data: Incorporate alternative data sources like news feeds, social media sentiment, or economic indicators for a more comprehensive market analysis.

3. Infrastructure Setup

High-Speed Data Processing: Establish a system capable of processing large volumes of data quickly. This is crucial for real-time decision making in high-frequency trading.
Cloud Computing or Dedicated Servers: Choose a hosting solution with minimal latency to ensure the fastest possible execution of trades.

4. Algorithm Development

Coding the Bot: Write the bot's core code in a programming language compatible with Solana, like Rust or C++. The code should include the logic for executing trades based on the AI and machine learning algorithms.
Smart Contract Development: If the bot interacts directly with the blockchain, develop smart contracts for Solana using Rust or C++.

5. Risk Management (define 2% daily return floor)

Stop-Loss and Take-Profit: Implement mechanisms to limit losses and secure profits. This might involve dynamic adjustments based on market conditions.
Position Sizing: Develop rules for determining the size of each trade, which is crucial for managing risk.

6. Backtesting

Historical Simulation: Run the bot against historical market data to evaluate its performance and refine the trading algorithms.
Forward Testing: Test the bot in a simulated real-time environment to assess its performance under current market conditions.

8. Deployment

Solana Deployment: Deploy the bot on the Solana blockchain, ensuring it has access to necessary resources and data feeds.
Monitoring Tools: Set up monitoring tools to track the bot's performance and identify any issues in real-time.
